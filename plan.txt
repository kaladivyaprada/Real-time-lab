Great idea. Here’s a copy‑pastable master prompt for Lovable to generate CareLink Rural, plus follow‑up prompts for iterations. Keep it tight and deterministic to get the best results.

### Master prompt for Lovable
Build “CareLink Rural”: an offline‑first telehealth MVP focused on low-connectivity use. Deliver 3 deployable apps in one monorepo.

Scope
- Mobile app (React Native + Expo)
- Backend API (FastAPI + Postgres via Supabase)
- Web clinician dashboard (React + Vite + Chakra UI)

Non-negotiables
- Offline-first records with SQLite and an “outbox” queue
- On-device vitals: start with heart rate via camera, stub others
- SMS fallback via Twilio when HTTP fails
- Auto-sync when connectivity returns
- Minimal PHI in SMS; use patient codes
- Simple priority queue on dashboard with location pin
